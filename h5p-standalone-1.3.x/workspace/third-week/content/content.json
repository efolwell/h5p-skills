He often refers to this as \"heartfulness,\" highlighting the deep connection between being present and being compassionate toward oneself.\u200b<\/p><p>In his teachings, Kabat-Zinn points out that many of us have an inner critic: a voice that judges and criticises our actions and feelings. This self-judgment can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and a diminished sense of well-being. By practicing mindfulness, we learn to observe our thoughts and emotions without judgment, creating space to respond to ourselves with understanding and care.\u200b<\/p><p>One effective method Kabat-Zinn recommends is the Loving-Kindness Meditation (Metta).
